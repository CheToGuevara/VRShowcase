Positional tracking is very important towards achieving immersion and presence in virtual reality. There are many ways to achieve positional tracking.
Magnetic tracking relies on measuring the intensity of the magnetic field in various directions.
Magnetic tracking has been implemented in several products, such as the Razer Hydra.
On the other hand:
There are several methods of optical tracking, all using various cameras to obtain positional information.
A video camera or multiple video cameras constantly seek the markers and then use various algorithms to extract the position of the object from the markers, like Oculus Rift. 
Another method to achieve tracking is with a depth map camera. A depth map camera, like the Kinect from Microsoft,  use various technologies (structured light, time of flight) to create a real-time map of the distances of the objects from the camera.





Virtual reality has beginnings that preceded the time that the concept was coined and formalised.
Morton Heilig developed the Sensorama (patented 1962) which was an arcade-style theatre cabinet that would stimulate all the senses, not just sight and sound. 
In 1968 Ivan Sutherland and his student Bob Sproull created the first VR / AR head mounted display (Sword of Damocles) that was connected to a computer and not a camera.
The Super Cockpit program in 1986 that Tom describes a system where you “put on a magic helmet, magic flight suit, and magic gloves”
was a prototype visual environment system that was made by NASA at their Ames Research Center. 
VPL was the first virtual reality where Jaron developed a range of virtual reality gear including the Dataglove.
Few months ago, Mark Zuckerberg is showing off a new way to interact with the Oculus Rift.


It is a good manner, to take a medium distance. Not small or large text. And ever, ever, test it yourself.
Place the important things in the middle angle to avoid large rotation of the neck!
